### BookSwap
Our group has discussed and identified a problem a majority of students have. Every semester, students spend hundreds of dollars on textbooks for their classes. Students can rent textbooks from services like Amazon or Chegg, but students are often required to buy textbooks from the university bookstore. At the end of the semester, these books either sit collecting dust, or are possibly resold at a depreciated value. 
 
To solve this issue, we are going to create BookSwap - a mobile application which allows users to scan their used textbooks, and post it to a marketplace for their university and find potential buyers. Here, students can directly conduct business with one another and easily buy or sell their used textbooks at a fraction of the cost!

Students will start by choosing the university they attend, and then are directed to a marketplace of other students who are selling their used textbooks. To buy a book, easily make an offer or message the seller within the app. To sell, just scan your textbook, name your price, and post to the marketplace. Itâ€™s that easy!

Programming Languages Used:
To build our app, we will primarily use JavaScript. We will use the React Native framework to incorporate JavaScript to build our rich mobile UI. To create the backend of our application, we will use Firebase. It is offers free storage and provides OAuth to link our application with Google, Twitter, Facebook and other accounts. To communicate with our Firebase database, we will use Node.js framework.
